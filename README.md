## Introduction

Test automation is the process of using software tools and frameworks to automate test execution, compare actual outcomes to expected outcomes, and generate test reports. This helps to increase efficiency, accuracy, and repeatability of testing processes, as well as reducing the time and costs associated with manual testing. <br><br>We are going to use tools and test frameworks like TestNG with Cucumber for the automation. This project focuses on automating tests for the Note Apps using Appium.

## Scope

The project covers the following areas of the Note Apps:

- Register activity (registering account)
- Login activity (login using valid and invalid credentials)
- Note Activity (Create Read Update Delete)

## Features

- Uses Appium for interacting with android application elements and performing automated actions.
- Organizes test scenarios using Cucumber and TestNG testing framework.
- Includes a wide range of test cases covering register, login, CRUD note.
- Provides easy-to-understand bug reports and test outcomes.


## Tools and Technologies Used

This test automation project for Note Apps utilizes a variety of tools and technologies to streamline the testing process and ensure efficient and accurate results.

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for writing the test automation code.

- **Appium**: an open-source framework that automates testing for mobile applications
- 
- **Cucumber Gherkin**: A plain-text language that uses keywords to define test scenarios in a structured way, making them easy to read and understand.

- **TestNG**: A popular and most widely used testing framework for Selenium automation.

- **UiAutomator2**: A test automation framework for Android devices.

- **Maven**: A build and dependency management tool that simplifies project setup and maintenance.

- **IntelliJ IDE**:  An integrated development environment (IDE) written in Java for developing computer software written in Java, Kotlin, Groovy, and other JVM-based languages.

- **Qase**:  A modern test management platform for manual & automated QA testing & reporting that helps your team deliver a higher quality product, faster.

These technologies are combined to create an effective testing framework that automates test cases, performs comparisons between expected and actual outcomes, and generates detailed test reports.


## Test Cases

The test cases are written in third-party platform using [Qase](https://qase.io/). Each test case covers various aspects of the Note Apps, ensuring comprehensive coverage.
